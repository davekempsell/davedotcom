          <p>I started my journey in software development in early 2022 after working within performance sport for over a decade. I quit my job and enrolled in a 12 week, full-time bootcamp with Makers Academy. I have always had strong attention to detail, and a desire to innovate. Graduating from the bootcamp has allowed me to add solid understanding of Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development to these skills.</p>
          <p>I'm constantly looking to push myself out of my comfort zone to learn something new. I love the problem-solving aspect of coding, finding the best solutions user problems, and the need to be continuously learning and developing.</p>
