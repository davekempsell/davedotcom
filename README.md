This is my personal, portfolio site, designed to showcase who I am, and what I have built with personal projects.

## Description

It is built in React, using Node.js, and hosted at www.davekempsell.com through AWS Amplify. I have used 'react-router-dom' to create a multi-page react app, which allows easy navigation as well the ability to share the URL for various components of the site, such as example projects.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Dependencies

This project was built including the following dependences:

* 'react-router-dom' - for creating a multi-page app, react-router-dom allows routing within the app, using the BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link, and NavLink components from the library.
* 'react-swipeable' - used to create a swipeable carousel, allowing components to action functions on swipe events.
* 'react-icons' - a [React library](https://react-icons.github.io/) that provides thoudsands of free, Open Source icons. 

### Installing

To run this project, clone the repository and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies.

### Executing program

```
npm start
```

This will launch the app on localhost:3000
